/**
 * The Pipe class is a buffered pipe where you may insert data in one
 * end, and read it back out from the other (like a normal pipe).
 *
 * Instead of using customized iosteram buffers and allows for that kind
 * of use, this class provides a "produce" method and a "consume" method
 * where you provide a callback which receives the memory area it may operate
 * on so that it can perform more optimal IO by populating the buffer
 * directly:
 *
 *    pipe.produce([&sock](void* data, size_t size) -> ssize_t {
 *        return cb::net::recv(sock, data, size, 0);
 *    });
 *
 *    And now you may use the data by calling:
 *
 *    pipe.consume([](const void* data, size_t size) -> ssize_t {
 *        // do whatever we want with the data
 *        return nbytes;
 *    });
 *
 * The return value from the consume method is the number of bytes you've
 * consumed (so that they may be dropped from the pipe). It means that if
 * you just want to look at the bytes you would return 0, and they would
 * still be present the next time you invoke the consume method.
 *
 * The pipe class is _not_ thread-safe as it provides absolutely no
 * locking internally.
 *
 * Implementation details:
 *
 * The Pipe is implemented by using allocating an underlying buffer of a
 * fixed size. The caller may grow this buffer by calling ensureCapacity,
 * which would:
 *
 *    * return immediately if available segment at the end is big enough
 *    * pack the buffer if the free segment at the end and the beginning
 *      is big enough
 *    * reallocate the underlying buffer if we need more space
 *
 * As you can see from the above the last two bullets would invalidate
 * all addresses previously provided to the "produce" and "consume" methods
 * which means that you _cannot_ keep pointers into this buffer and use
 * ensureCapacity.
 *
 * Data written to the pipe is always put at the end of the allocated
 * buffer, and the write_head is moved forward. Data is always read from
 * the read_head, and once consumed the read head is moved forward. Whenever
 * the read_head catch up with the write_head they're both set to 0 (the
 * beginning of the buffer).
 */
